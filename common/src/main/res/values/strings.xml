        Dear User,\n\n

        Becycle was a pet project created from an effort to streamline and facilitate garbage collection services, and make life easier for both end users as the collective powers currently offering these services.\n\n
        A part of this vision was also decentralization, granting individuals more insight and ownership of the processes involved. Sadly, the latter part doesn\'t correspond with the current vision of the involved organisations,
        and through informal communication an agreement was reached to halt the project to prevent further escalation. \n\n

        Pushing the project onwards could either be perceived as a hostile action against the organisations in charge, and/or the operational aspects of keeping this project running would become hugely resource-intensive,
        far beyond the time &amp; money I intended to invest in it.\n\n

        If there are certain features and/or aspects of this app you\'ve enjoyed and would like to see in other garbage collection apps, I would strongly advise you to contact their support department and make a feature request.
        I\'m going to release the codebase for this app as open-source, allowing any-and-all other parties to freely make use of what was offered in Becycle.\n\n

        As a small project, I would like to thank all of you for the trust and kind words you have shared with me, and I hope you will find a suitable alternative soon!\n\n

        Kind regards,\n
        Bojan Belic\n
